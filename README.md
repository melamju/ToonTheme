# Toon Theme

This is a 3D-scene implemented in the OpenGL-Template.

## Shader
This scene is focusing on the shader, which is a toon-shader, also known as cel-shader.  
This shader is a common technique in east-asian-styled games and art.  

## Scene

The model is 2B from the game called NieR:Automata, she fits the theme and shader perfectly.  
  
You can manipulate the time of day (the light) of this scene.  
* The ***D-Key*** lets the sun/moon rise/set ***clockwise***.
* The ***A-Key*** lets the sun/moon rise/set ***counter-clockwise***.
